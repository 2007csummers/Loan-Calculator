# Loan Planner
***
## A Brief Synopsis
The loan planner application is a lightweight application that allows the user to create up to 14 loans. The loans are then 
simulated through their lifetime and data is recorded at each simulated payment. Some of this data can be viewed in two graphs
(principal over time and interest accrued through date). A "snapshot" of the user's loans can be saved or opened from their computer.
